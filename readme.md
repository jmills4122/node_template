#Shogi Web App


##About the App
This web application was created as the final project of CIS 526(Web Interface Design) at Kansas State University. It was made by Joseph Mills and Aaron Doolittle. The code is in a semi complete state and has a functioning version of the Shogi chess game. It may be worked on further to add additional features such as a tutorial and online play.


##About Shogi
Shogi is Japanese version of chess with a few important changes made. The most drastic of the changes made is the allowance of players to put captured opponentâ€™s pieces back onto the board and use them as their own. The other main change from traditional chess is the act of piece promotion can happen on the three rows closest to an opponent and the promoted pieces have drastically different move sets.
